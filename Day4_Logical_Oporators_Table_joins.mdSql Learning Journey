## Focus of the Day

**Logical Operators and Table Joins**

Day 4 introduces two powerful ideas that define real SQL work:

* Applying multiple conditions using logical operators
* Combining data from multiple tables using joins

These skills are essential when databases grow beyond a single table.

---

## Exercise 1: Filtering Data with Logical Operators (AND, OR, NOT)

### Objective

Create an `Employees` table and retrieve employees who:

* Are located in **Kaduna or Lagos**
* Earn a salary **above 50,000**

The output should include name, email, phone number, and state.

---

### Why This Matters

Real-world queries rarely rely on a single condition. Logical operators allow SQL to express **business rules clearly**, such as targeting specific locations while enforcing salary thresholds.

This is commonly used in:

* Payroll analysis
* Regional reporting
* Eligibility and compliance checks

---

### Sample Table Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    phone_number VARCHAR(20),
    state VARCHAR(50)
);
```

---

### Query

```sql
SELECT
    name,
    email,
    phone_number,
    state
FROM Employees
WHERE (state = 'Kaduna' OR state = 'Lagos')
  AND salary > 50000;
```

---

### Explanation

* `OR` allows multiple acceptable states
* `AND` ensures the salary condition is also met
* Parentheses control logic order and prevent errors

This ensures only employees who meet **both location and salary criteria** are returned.

---

## Exercise 2: Joining Tables with INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN

### Objective

Use two tables—`Customers` and `Orders`—to:

1. Display only customers who have placed orders (INNER JOIN)
2. Display all customers, including those without orders (LEFT JOIN)

---

### Why This Matters

Most databases are relational. Data is split across tables to avoid duplication. Joins allow you to **reconstruct meaningful information** across those tables.

Understanding joins is critical for:

* Transaction analysis
* Customer behavior tracking
* Reporting across systems

---

### Sample Table Structures

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2)
);
```

---

### INNER JOIN Query

```sql
SELECT
    Customers.customer_name,
    Orders.order_date,
    Orders.amount
FROM Customers
INNER JOIN Orders
ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;
```

### Explanation

* Returns only customers with matching orders
* Useful for analyzing completed transactions

---

### LEFT JOIN Query

```sql
SELECT
    Customers.customer_name,
    Orders.order_date,
    Orders.amount
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders
ON Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id;
```

### Explanation

* Returns all customers
* Includes customers without orders (NULL values)
* Useful for identifying inactive or new customers

---

## Key Takeaways from Day 4

* Logical operators help model real business rules
* Parentheses improve clarity and correctness
* INNER JOIN filters to matching records only
* LEFT JOIN preserves all records from the main table

---

## Challenges & Insights

### Challenges

* Mixing `AND` and `OR` without parentheses can cause incorrect results
* Forgetting which table is on the LEFT in a LEFT JOIN

### Insights

* SQL logic reads like structured thinking
* Joins are the backbone of relational databases
* Mastering joins unlocks complex analysis

**End of Day 4**

Day 4 moves SQL from single-table thinking to relational reasoning — a major step forward.
